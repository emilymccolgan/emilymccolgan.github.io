<h2>My background- </h2>

<p> For me, my background with IT started with my father. I don’t necessarily have a large background in technology- as my dad is usually my go to with all things related to this subject.</p>
<h2>My interest in web development- </h2>
<p>I don’t typically have much interest in making web development my career. But, I think that the skills and techniques that will be taught in this class will help me in any sort of career in my future.</p>
<h2>My extra-curricular interests, sports, or hobbies- </h2>
 <p>Most of my spare time is spent playing or listening to music. I love to play the piano and sing. It is my favorite thing to do. I enjoy spending time in nature, I am a lover of all creatures. I love spending time with my pug.</p>
<h2>What I hope to gain from this course- </h2>
<p>I hope to gather a better understanding with canvas and the internet feel sort of disconnected when it comes to technology. I hope to gain knowledge from class, and to feel more comfortable with the inter web. I want to be confident with the internet and coding.</p>
<h2>Topics or ideas</h2>
<p>I am interested in the whole course load. I do not know much about any of it. So, I think I am most interested in learning about the cultural aspect of the web. </p>
