<p>Music to me is everything. I started singing since before I can remember; but as for playing the piano<br>
  I was about 5 years old. It did not click until I used the two together. Once I used my skills together,<br>
I knew this was my continuing passion. It is what I am supposed to do.</p>

    <p>I began to sing with my fathers band in middle school. It was a game changer. I then was able to see how much fun <br>
it truly is to play with people who love it like you. I continued to sing with them until they stopped playing together. <br>
It was a difficult time to not be playing with a band. But when I graduated high school, my dad found another group to play with.<br>
I became lead singer of what is now called Generation Knot. I am constantly looking for new people to jam with.<br>
Music is never ending fun. It brings me joy to share my music covers here to you!</p>
